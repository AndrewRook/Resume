\section{\centerline{\large EXPERIENCE}}
{\bf Senior Manager, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2018-Present}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Deployed the first cloud-based credit card underwriting model
    in the company via a dockerized Python API, with an estimated
    incremental value of \$35MM per year.
  \item Led development of modernized model monitoring package,
    decreasing the time and effort required to complete compliance-required model
    monitoring.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Manager, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2016-2018}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Built a Python library to facilitate the creation of robust, production-ready data analysis pipelines,
    saving hundreds of hours of R\&D effort across multiple production
    models.
  \item Led development of a prototype automated machine learning model
    deployment scheme for cloud-based applications, influencing the
    development direction for the company-wide credit card application
    processing platform.
  \item Constructed a Python model to predict credit card spend
    based on application information 25\% better than existing procedure,
    and advised leadership on its value and proper use.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Principal Data Scientist}\hfill\mbox{2014-2016}\\
Capital One Labs
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
  \item Implemented a novel approach to deliver internal technical
    trainings, providing over 5000 hours of classes with no instructors.
  \item Programmed and deployed an interactive course completion dashboard using Flask
    and dc.js to provide progress reports to individual students as
    well as company leadership.
  \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Data Science Fellow}\hfill\mbox{2014}\\
The Data Incubator
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Formulated a model to predict flight
                      delay times based on
                      historical airline on-time arrivals.
                    \item Created a web interface to provide interactive itinerary
                      input and visualizations to intuitively
                      display model results.
                    \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Graduate and Postdoctoral Researcher}\hfill\mbox{2007-2014}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Devised a fast Voronoi Tessellation
                      algorithm in Python
                      to adaptively bin images, preserving spatial
                      resolution while maximizing signal in images
                      with over one million pixels.
                   \item Assembled a hybrid C++/Python
                     pipeline to process hundreds of high-resolution images with
                     minimal user intervention, resulting in a 10x increase in analysis precision.
                  \end{itemize}
