\section{\centerline{\large WORK EXPERIENCE}}
{\bf Capital One}\hfill\mbox{2014-Present}\\
{\it Principal Associate Data Scientist— Staff Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer}
\vspace*{0.05 in}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt 

  \item Built a RAG app using Mixtral and ChromaDB to generate business-specific SQL queries from plaintext prompts, achieving accuracies of over 80\% of a test dataset of real queries.
  \item Prototyped a from-scratch transformer model using Pytorch trained on historical analyst SQL queries.
  \item Deployed the first cloud-based credit card underwriting model
    in the company via a dockerized Python API, with an estimated
    incremental value of 35 million dollars per year.
  \item Created the longest-lived, most successful
    internal data science tool in the company, used in production models by dozens of
    data scientists across multiple lines of business.
  \item Programmed and deployed an interactive course completion dashboard using Flask
    and dc.js to provide progress reports to individual students as
    well as company leadership.
  \end{itemize}

{\bf University of Wisconsin-Madison}\hfill\mbox{2007-2014}\\
{\it Graduate Student — Postdoctoral Researcher}
                  \vspace* {0.05 in}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
                    \item Created a fast Voronoi Tessellation algorithm in Python
                      to adaptively bin images, preserving spatial
                      resolution while maximizing signal in images
                      with over one million pixels.
                    \item Developed non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt
                      $\chi^{2}$ fitting algorithms using a
                      combination of Python and C++ to constrain
                      models of spiral galaxies to data. 
                   \item Employed on-campus distributed computing resources to perform large-scale modeling in
parallel, using over 20 years of computer time in 1 month.
                   \item Assembled a hybrid C++/Python processing
                     pipeline to clean, register, and
                     mosaic thousands of high-resolution images with
                     minimal user intervention, resulting in a factor
                     of 10+ increase in analysis precision.
                  \end{itemize}
