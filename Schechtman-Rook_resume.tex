\section{\centerline{\large WORK EXPERIENCE}}
{\bf Director, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2023-Present}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
  \item Designed and built a package to streamline core business
    metrics SQL calculations, regularly used by over 60 analysts for critical
    reporting needs. 
  \item Owned the design, implementation, and upkeep of the DS
    Technical Interview, a key interview given to every data science
    candidate in the US.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Senior Manager, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2018-2023}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Guided ongoing development of the core credit card valuations model scoring platform, delivering regular releases of new and updated models while improving the robustness and maintainability of platform infrastructure. 
  \item Led technical development of model monitoring tools, mentoring three junior data scientists to deliver a maintainable package on time and to spec.
  \item Deployed the first cloud-based credit card application underwriting model
    in the company via a dockerized Python API, with an estimated
    incremental value of \$35MM per year.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Manager, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2016-2018}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Led development of a prototype language-agnostic automated machine learning model
    deployment framework for cloud-based applications, influencing the
    development direction for the company-wide credit card application
    processing platform.
  \item Created the longest-lived, most successful
    internal data science tool in the company, used in production models by dozens of
    data scientists across multiple lines of business.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Principal Data Scientist}\hfill\mbox{2014-2016}\\
Capital One Labs
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
  \item Implemented a novel approach to deliver internal technical
    trainings, providing over 5000 hours of classes with no instructors.
  \item Programmed and deployed an interactive course completion dashboard using Flask
    and dc.js to provide progress reports to individual students as
    well as company leadership.
  \end{itemize}

{\bf Postdoctoral Research Associate}\hfill\mbox{2014}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Devised metrics to improve correspondence between numerical models and
                      astronomical data. Implemented in highly
                      optimized Python, was able to refine agreement by
                      up to 20\% with minimal increase in computation time.
                    \item Built a fast Voronoi Tessellation algorithm
                      to adaptively bin images, preserving spatial
                      resolution while maximizing signal in images
                      with over one million pixels.
                    \item Trained and mentored undergraduate and
                      graduate students in programming, data analysis and statistical methods.
                    \end{itemize}

{\bf Research Assistant}\hfill\mbox{2007-2013}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Developed non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt
                      $\chi^{2}$ fitting algorithms using a
                      combination of Python and C++ to constrain
                      models of spiral galaxies to data. 
                   \item Employed on-campus distributed computing
                     resources to perform large-scale modeling in parallel, using over 20 years of 
                     computer timein 1 month.
                   \item Assembled a hybrid C++/Python processing
                     pipeline to clean, register, and
                     mosaic thousands of high-resolution images with
                     minimal user intervention, resulting in a factor
                     of 10+ increase in analysis precision.
                   \item Created a genetic
                     algorithm in C++ to efficiently fit galaxy models with
                     unusually large numbers of
                     free parameters to high-resolution images.
                  \end{itemize}
