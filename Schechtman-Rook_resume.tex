                    \item Devised new metrics to determine the cause
                      of mis-match between numerical models and
                      astronomical data.
                    \item Implemented a Voronoi Tesselation algorithm
                      to maximize spatial resolution and signal in

                    \item Developed non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt
                      $\chi^{2}$ fitting algorithms to constrain

                   \item Employed on-campus distributed computing
                     resources to perform large-scale modeling in parallel, using over 20 years of computer time
                     in 1 month.
                   \item Created a genetic
                     algorithm to efficiently fit galaxy models with
                     unusually large numbers of
                     free parameters to high-resolution images.
                   \item Utilized frequency-domain analysis to
                     understand the spatial distribution of galactic structure.
                  \item Computed descriptive statistics about
                    200+ astronomical objects from raw survey data
                    automatically via custom-built analysis software.
                  \item Implemented methods comparing different
                    fitting statistics to compute global best-fitting
                    parameters for multiple datasets. 
                  \item Discovered and classified a previously unknown
                    galaxy by simultaneously using data from seven different sources.
