                    \item Devised new metrics to determine the cause
                      of mis-match between numerical models and

                   \item Employed on-campus distributed computing
                     resources to perform large-scale modeling, using over 20 years of computer time

                     free parameters to high-resolution images.
                   \item Utilized frequency-domain analysis to
                     understand the spatial distribution of galactic structure.
                  \item Computed descriptive statistics about
                    200+ astronomical objects from raw survey data

                    galaxy by simultaneously using data from seven different sources.
