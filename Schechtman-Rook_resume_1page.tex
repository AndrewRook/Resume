\section{\centerline{\large EXPERIENCE}}
{\bf Manager, Data Science}\hfill\mbox{2016-Present}\\
Capital One
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item Created a Python library to facilitate the creation and
    refinement of robust, production-ready data analysis pipelines,
    saving hundreds of hours of R\&D effort.
  \item Led development of a proof-of-concept automated machine learning model
    deployment scheme for cloud-based applications.
  \item Constructed a Python model to predict credit card spend
    based on application information 25\% better than existing procedure,
    and advised leadership on its value and proper use.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Principal Data Scientist}\hfill\mbox{2014-2016}\\
Capital One Labs
\vspace*{0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
  \item Implemented a novel approach to deliver internal technical
    trainings, providing over 5000 hours of classes with no instructors.
  \item Programmed and deployed an interactive course completion dashboard using Flask
    and dc.js to provide progress reports to individual students as
    well as company leadership.
  \item Engineered a credit card payment simulator, allowing a product team
    to gain actionable insights without expensive pilot programs.
  \end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.15in}

{\bf Data Science Fellow}\hfill\mbox{2014}\\
The Data Incubator
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Formulated a model to predict flight
                      delay times based on
                      historical airline on-time arrivals.
                    \item Built a web interface to provide interactive itinerary
                      input and visualizations to intuitively
                      display model results.
                    \end{itemize}

{\bf Graduate and Postdoctoral Researcher}\hfill\mbox{2007-2014}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Devised a fast Voronoi Tessellation
                      algorithm in Python
                      to adaptively bin images, preserving spatial
                      resolution while maximizing signal in images
                      with over one million pixels.
                   \item Assembled a hybrid C++/Python
                     pipeline to process hundreds of high-resolution images with
                     minimal user intervention, resulting in a 10x increase in analysis precision.
                  \end{itemize}

{\bf Independent NFL Analyst}\hfill\mbox{2013-Present}\\
phdfootball.blogspot.com
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Designed a responsive online dashboard
                      allowing users to visually filter 350,000
                      plays to identify and explore
                      interesting game situations.
                    \item Authored a Python library to compute
                      play-by-play win probabilities based on game situation.
                    \item Developed a program to automatically remove
                      camera motion from NFL game footage. 
                  \end{itemize}
