\section{\centerline{\large EXPERIENCE}}
{\bf Data Science Fellow}\hfill\mbox{2014-Present}\\
The Data Incubator
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Trained a model on
                      historical airline on-time arrival data to predict flight
                      delay times.
                    \item Designed web interface to simplify itinerary
                      input and intuitively
                      display results.
                    \end{itemize}

{\bf Postdoctoral Research Associate}\hfill\mbox{2014-Present}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Improved agreement between numerical models
                      and astronomical data by 20\%, using vectorized
                      numpy operations and specialized libraries to
                      preserve run time.
                    \item Built a fast Voronoi Tessellation algorithm
                      to adaptively bin images, preserving spatial
                      resolution while maximizing signal in images
                      with over one million pixels.
                    \end{itemize}

                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    \item Mined a play-by-play database containing
                      over 500,000 records across dozens of tables
                      for deep relationships between individual players
                      as well as teams. 
                    \item Explained findings to a broad audience through both written posts and evocative figures.

{\bf Research Assistant}\hfill\mbox{2007-2013}\\
University of Wisconsin-Madison
                  \vspace* {0.01 in}\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
                    % \item Developed a non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt
                    %   $\chi^{2}$ fitting algorithm using a
                    %   combination of Python and C++ to constrain
                    %   models of spiral galaxies to data. 
                   \item Employed on-campus distributed computing
                     resources to perform large-scale modeling in parallel, using over 20 years of computer time
                     in 1 month.
                   \item Assembled a hybrid C++/Python processing
                     pipeline to process hundreds of high-resolution images with
                     minimal user intervention, resulting in a 10x increase in analysis precision.
                   \item Created a genetic
                     algorithm in C++ to efficiently fit complex galaxy models to high-resolution images.
                   % \item Utilized frequency-domain analysis to
                   %   understand the spatial distribution of galactic structure.
                  \item Computed descriptive statistics about
                    200+ astronomical objects from raw survey data
                    automatically via custom-built analysis software
                    blending C++ and shell scripting programs.
                  \end{itemize}

                    \item Designed and executed statistical analyses
                      of simulated galaxy clusters to optimize
                      strategy for future data acquisition.
                    \item Used 
                      regression analysis to compute a conversion
                      between astronomical filter systems.
